                  Google's Android phones offers its users free access to Google Maps and provide navigation and communication. Google is also branching into other areas as well, as the famous Google cars that operate on their own. This is part of Google's vision of a future where cars drive themselves and people can participate in more productive activities during their commute. The site Google+ is part of Google's vision for social media, which is integrated in the phones and all other aspects of life.

                  Google’s original mission statement was “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” In 2014, Page suggested the Internet giant was due for a change to mission statement. “I think we do, probably,” Page told The Financial Times. “We’re still trying to work that out.”

                  <p>
                  It's really the people that make Google the kind of company it is. Google hires people who are intelligent and targeted and puts more emphasis on one's abilities than experience. although all the employees in charge have the same common goals and visions for the company, they come from different walks of life and speak many different languages, reflecting their global audience. And when employees do not work, have Googlers interests ranging between everything from cycling to beekeeping and from frisbee to foxtrot.
